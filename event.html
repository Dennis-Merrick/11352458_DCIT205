<br>This year’s fair is not just a celebration of the intrinsic beauty of plants and flowers but a clarion call to recognize their profound impact on our health and the planet’s sustainability. Amidst our busy lives, we often overlook the sheer power of nature to transform our well-being and to offer solutions to pressing environmental challenges. The fair aims to illuminate the myriad benefits of plants—from air purification and stress reduction to their role in a health-promoting plant-based diet.

        <h2>Distribution of Laptops - One Student One Laptop (1S1L) initiative</h2>

        <p><span class="bold"> Date:</span> <br>
            Wednesday, November 8, 2023 - 09:00<br>
           <span class="bold"> Venue:</span> <br>
            Cedi Conference Centre<br><br>
             
            
            The Vice Chancellor’s office at the University of Ghana is thrilled to bring to your attention the "One Student One Laptop" (1S1L) initiative which commenced in 2021. This visionary program aims to provide each student with a laptop, a crucial tool for both academic and personal growth.
            
            <br><br>In today's digital age, technology access is not a luxury but a necessity. The Vice-Chancellor believes that every student should have the opportunity to excel academically, enhance their skills, and prepare for the challenges of the modern world.
            
            <br><br>Therefore, the 1S1L initiative seeks to address the lack of technology skills caused by the inaccessibility of learning systems and tools that a functional laptop can offer.
            
            <br><br>To ensure equal access to technology, a select number of laptops will be provided entirely free of charge based on academic performance, financial need, and potential contributions to our academic community. This free laptop assistance is facilitated through the Students Financial Aid Office, eliminating financial barriers to students’ success.
            
            <br><br> Our inaugural 1S1L distribution took place in August 2022, and we've successfully conducted two more since then.
            
            <br><br> <span class="bold"> We're excited to announce the next distribution on November 8, 2023, at 9:00 a.m., which will be held at the Cedi Conference Center. We warmly extend an invitation to everyone to join us for this event.</span>
            
            <br><br> We also wish to extend our heartfelt appreciation to our dedicated individual and corporate sponsors whose generous support in donating laptops to students has been invaluable, and upon whom we will continue to rely for our 1S1L initiative.’
            
            <br><br> For those who may not qualify for a free laptop but still need affordable access, we are offering hire purchase options. These laptops will be available to you at a significantly reduced cost, payable in convenient instalments throughout your school year.
            
            <br><br> In addition to providing laptops, we are establishing an assembling plant on our campus. This facility will not only contribute to student job creation, economic development, and project sustainability, but it will also provide students with a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience in technology assembly, contributing to skills development and future employability.
            
            <br><br> This initiative is a testament to the Vice Chancellor’s commitment to student growth and success. The VC believes that access to technology is a fundamental right, and this program is a significant step toward creating a level playing field for all our students.
            
            <br><br> Additional information on the application and selection process is available on the University’s website.</p>
